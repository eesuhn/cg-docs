> 👍 **Tips**
> 
> - Using `checks` param to filter pools based on various checks:
>   - `checks=no_honeypot` — Filter out Honeypot pools, using GoPlus Token Security and De.Fi Scanner.
>   - `checks=good_gt_score` — Show only pools with a GT Score of at least 75.
>   - `checks=on_coingecko` — Show only pools with tokens that are listed on CoinGecko.
>   - `checks=has_social` — Show only pools with their social links and token information updated.
> - You may include values such as `page` to specify which page of responses you would like to show.

> 📘 **Notes**
> 
> - `dexes` param can only be used when **only 1 `networks`** is specified.
> - If the token's market cap is not verified by the team, the API response will return `null` for its market cap value, even though it has a displayed value on GeckoTerminal, which might not be accurate as it often matches the Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV).
> - Attributes specified in the `include` param will be returned under the top-level `"included"` key.
> - This endpoint returns up to 20 pools per page. Use the `page` param to navigate more results.
> - Cache/Update frequency: every 60 seconds.
> - 💼 Exclusive for [Paid Plan](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) subscribers (Analyst plan or above).
