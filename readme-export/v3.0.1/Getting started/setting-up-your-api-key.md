## 2. Making API Request

- The root URL for the CoinGecko Public Demo Plan API is `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/`.
- Refer to the [Authentication](/reference/authentication) page for detailed information.
- For a demonstration using the [Ping](/reference/ping-server) Endpoint, use the following example:  
  `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/ping?x_cg_demo_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY`
- Feel free to experiment with [Ping](/reference/ping-server) or other endpoints in the documentation by entering your API Key in the `x-cg-demo-api-key` section and clicking the "Try It!" button.

## 4. API Usage Report

- You can monitor your API usage in the Usage Report section, which provides details such as:
  - Total Monthly API Calls.
  - Remaining Monthly API Calls.
  - Rate Limit (Request Per Minute) — maximum number of API requests allowed in one minute.
  - Last Used - the timestamp of the last used instance.
