## CoinGecko API Authentication Method

If this is your first time using the Demo API key, you can supply API Key to the root URL using one of these ways:

1. Header (Recommended): `x-cg-demo-api-key`
2. Query String Parameter: `x_cg_demo_api_key`

| Authentication Method  | Example using [Ping](/reference/ping-server) Endpoint                                      |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Header (cURL)          | `curl -X GET "https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/ping" -H "x-cg-demo-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"` |
| Query String Parameter | `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/ping?x_cg_demo_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY`                     |
