>

>   - refers to respective coin page and find ‘API ID’.
>   - refers to [`/coins/list`](/reference/coins-list) endpoint.
>   - refers to google sheets [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wTTuxXt8n9q7C4NDXqQpI3wpKu1_5bGVmP9Xz0XGSyU/edit?usp=sharing).
> - You may use tools like [epoch converter ](https://www.epochconverter.com) to convert human readable date to UNIX timestamp.

> 📘 **Notes**
> 
> - You may leave the interval as empty for automatic granularity:
>   - 1 day from current time = **5-minutely** data
>   - 2 - 90 days from current time = **hourly** data
>   - above 90 days from current time = **daily** data (00:00 UTC)
> - Cache / Update Frequency:  
>   - Every 30 seconds for all the API plans (for last data point).
>   - The last completed UTC day (00:00) data is now available **10 minutes after midnight** on the next UTC day (00:10).
> - Access to historical data via the Public API (Demo plan) is **restricted to the past 365 days** only. To access the complete range of historical data, please subscribe to one of our [paid plans](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) to obtain a Pro-API key.
