> 👍 **Tips**
> 
> - You may add values such as `top_pools` in the include param to include top pools along with the pools information
> - If you would like to query token information such as image url, websites, description and etc. You can go to this endpoint [`/networks/{network}/tokens/{address}/info`](/reference/token_info_address) instead

> 📘 **Notes**
> 
> - Attributes specified in the `include ` params will be included under the "included" key at the top level
