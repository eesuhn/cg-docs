Recognizing the limitations of the paginated /coins feature, particularly its inability to query for specific coins, we have temporarily hidden it from the documentation to prevent confusion for new users. 

Rest assured, there are no plans to remove or deprecate it in the near future. 

Instead, we encourage you to transition to the more versatile [/coins/list](/reference/coins-list) and [coins/{id}](/reference/coins-id) options for a more tailored and efficient experience.
