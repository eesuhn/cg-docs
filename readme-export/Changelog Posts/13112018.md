To ensure the consistent uptime and scalability of this API, we can only provide a maximum of 100 tickers in the responses for a specific exchange through the [/exchanges/{id}](/reference/exchanges-id) endpoint. 

```json
{
  "name": "Binance",
  "year_established": 2017,
  ......
  "tickers": [...], //100 items ðŸ‘ˆ
  "status_updates": [...] //7 items
}
```

To retrieve more tickers, kindly utilize [/exchanges/{id}/tickers](/reference/exchanges-id-tickers) endpoint.
