Powered by GeckoTerminal, the CoinGecko API now supports on-chain data across **200+ blockchain networks**, including the latest additions: Hyperliquid, HyperEVM, Abstract, Berachain, Story, Monad, Unichain, and Soneium.

While we offer the widest on-chain data coverage, we understand that you may have specific needs when slicing and dicing data for your use case. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re introducing Megafilter, an exclusive endpoint available for our API paid plan subscribers (Analyst plan & above).

## ðŸ”¥ Whatâ€™s Megafilter?

This new endpoint provides unmatched flexibility, allowing you to query and filter data exactly the way you want.

## ðŸ‘€ What Can You Do?

With the /megafilter endpoint, you can slice and dice on-chain data your way across:

- 200+ blockchain networks, 1,400+ dexes, 6M+ pools, and 5M+ tokens
- Advanced filtering options based on liquidity, FDV, volume, transactions, buy/sell trends, and time range
- Custom sorting, including trending pools (5m), newest pools, or liquidity growth
- Fraud detection filters: Exclude honeypots, check GT Score, verify CG listings, and track social metrics

Here's some quick examples: 

- Track fresh pools on Uniswap V4 & Aerodrome with liquidity above $1,000
- Discover trending DEX pools across Solana, Base, and other chains with a high GT Score.
- Filter out risky pools with built-in honeypot protection & fraud checks
- Customize data retrieval based on your strategy: time-based, volume-based, or trend-driven
