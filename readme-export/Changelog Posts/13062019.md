We've implemented an enhancement to the [/coins/{id}/tickers](/reference/coins-id-tickers) and [/exchanges/{id}/tickers ](/reference/exchanges-id-tickers) endpoints. 

Now, users have the flexibility to use the optional `order` parameter, which defaults to trust_score_desc. 

This addition allows users to customize the sorting order of tickers based on trust score, providing a more tailored experience for data retrieval.
