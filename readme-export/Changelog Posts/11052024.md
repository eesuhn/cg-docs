We've introduced a new endpoint [/coins/{id}/ohlc/range](/reference/coins-id-ohlc-range).

This endpoint allows you to get the OHLC chart (Open, High, Low, Close) of a coin within a range of timestamp based on particular coin id.

Please note that this endpoint is available exclusively for **paid plan subscribers only**.
