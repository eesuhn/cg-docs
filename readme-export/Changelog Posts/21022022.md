We've introduced the Historical Circulating Supply endpoint exclusively for Enterprise plan subscribers. 

- [/coins/{id}/circulating_supply_chart](/reference/coins-id-circulating-supply-chart)
- [/coins/{id}/circulating_supply_chart/range](/reference/coins-id-circulating-supply-chart-range)

These endpoints provide access to historical circulating supply data of a specific coin.
