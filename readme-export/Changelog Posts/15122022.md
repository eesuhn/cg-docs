We've added exclusive NFTs beta endpoints for Paid Plan Subscribers. These endpoints include:

- [/nfts/{id}/market_chart](/reference/nfts-id-market-chart) (for historical market data)
- [/nfts/{contract_address}/market_chart](/reference/nfts-contract-address-market-chart) (for historical market data based on contract address)
- [/nfts/{id}/tickers](/reference/nfts-id-tickers) (to retrieve floor price and volume information on each marketplace)
