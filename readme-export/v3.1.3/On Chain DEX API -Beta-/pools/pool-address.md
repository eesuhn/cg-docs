> ðŸ“˜ **Notes**
> 
> - Address not found in GeckoTerminal will be ignored
> - If the token's market cap is not verified by the team, the API response will return null for its market cap value, even though it has a displayed value on GeckoTerminal, which might not be accurate as it often matches the Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV)
> - Attributes specified in the `include ` params will be included under the "included" key at the top level
> - Cache/Update frequency: every 60 seconds
