> - When using this endpoint, GeckoTerminal's routing decides the best pool for token price. The price source may change based on liquidity and pool activity. For full control over the price, you may use [`/networks/{network}/pools/{address}`](/reference/pool-address) endpoint by providing a specific pool address.
